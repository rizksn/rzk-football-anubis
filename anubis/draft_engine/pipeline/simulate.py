# =============================
# ðŸ§  RZK Draft Simulation Pipeline
# =============================

# This function orchestrates the full pick simulation logic.
# It wires together the modular stages of scoring, filtering,
# modifiers, and strategy into a clean, extensible funnel.

# -----------------------------
# Step 0: Load & Score Players
# -----------------------------
# - Load raw ADP from JSON
# - Score all players using the base model (ADP + variance)
# from scoring.adp_scoring import score_players

# raw_players = load_adp_file(adp_format_key)
# scored_players = score_players(raw_players)

# -----------------------------
# Step 1: Filter Out Drafted Players
# -----------------------------
# - Remove players already picked (from draft board)
# from filters.player_filter import get_drafted_player_ids

# drafted_ids = get_drafted_player_ids(draft_plan)
# available_players = [p for p in scored_players if p["player_id"] not in drafted_ids]

# -----------------------------
# Step 2: Early Round Behavior Overrides
# -----------------------------
# - Custom logic for picks 1â€“30 (e.g. ADP drift, hardcoded overrides)
# from modifiers.early_round_overrides import apply_early_round_model

# available_players = apply_early_round_model(
#     scored_players=available_players,
#     current_pick_number=current_pick_number,
#     league_format=league_format
# )

# -----------------------------
# Step 3: Positional Cap Filtering
# -----------------------------
# - Filter out positions based on draft format rules
# - Prevent early TE/QB floods in 1QB, etc.
# from filters.player_filter import filter_positional_needs

# available_players = filter_positional_needs(
#     candidates=available_players,
#     team_roster=team_roster,
#     league_format=league_format,
#     current_pick_number=current_pick_number
# )

# -----------------------------
# Step 4: Contextual Modifiers
# -----------------------------
# - Apply score penalties for already-drafted positions (e.g. QB, TE)
# from modifiers.contextual import apply_contextual_penalty

# available_players = apply_contextual_penalty(
#     candidates=available_players,
#     team_roster=team_roster,
#     league_format=league_format,
#     current_pick_number=current_pick_number
# )

# -----------------------------
# Step 5: User Weight Modifiers
# -----------------------------
# - Apply custom user sliders (e.g. favor RB, risk tolerance, youth)
# from modifiers.user_weights import apply_user_weights

# available_players = apply_user_weights(
#     candidates=available_players,
#     user_config=user_config  # (to be pa
